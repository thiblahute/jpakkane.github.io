As before this remains possible only with the Ninja backend. \nThe Vala compiler has an alternative syntax Genie that uses the gs file extension. Meson now recognises and uses Genie files. \nThe Pkgconfig module object can add arbitrary extra cflags to the Cflags value in the pc file using the extra_cflags keyword \nBase options are now accessible via the get_option function. \nRust targets now take an optional rust_crate_type keyword allowing you to set the crate type of the resulting artifact. Valid crate types are dylib or cdylib for shared libraries and rlib or staticlib for static libraries. For more see Rust s linkage reference. \nBoth the address and undefined behavior sanitizers can now be used simultaneously by passing Db_sanitize address undefined to Meson. \nThe new keyword implib to executable allows generation of an import library for the executable. \nYou can specify build_rpath foo bar in build targets and the given path will get added to the target s rpath in the build tree. It is removed during the install step. \nMeson will print a warning when the user tries to add an rpath linker flag manually e.g. via link_args to a target. This is not recommended because having multiple rpath causes them to stomp on each other. This warning will become a hard error in some future release. \n"});
