The compiler can either be a built target \nOr an external program provided by the system or script inside the source tree \nCustom targets can take zero or more input files and use them to generate one or more output files. Using a custom target you can run this compiler at build time to generate the sources \nThe INPUT there will be transformed to out.c out.h Just like the output you can also refer to each input file individually by index. \nThen you just put that in your program and you re done. \n"});
