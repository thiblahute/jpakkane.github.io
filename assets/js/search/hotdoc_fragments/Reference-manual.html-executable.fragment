fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#executable", "fragment": "executable \nCreates a new executable. The first argument specifies its name and the remaining positional arguments define the input files to use. They can be of the following types \nThese input files can be sources objects libraries or any other file. Meson will automatically categorize them based on the extension and use them accordingly. For instance sources c cpp vala rs etc will be compiled objects o obj and libraries so dll etc will be linked and all other files headers unknown extensions etc will be ignored. \nWith the Ninja backend Meson will create a build time order only dependency on all generated input files including unknown files. For all input files generated and non generated Meson uses the dependency file generated by your compiler to determine when to rebuild sources. The behavior is similar for other backends. \nExecutable supports the following keyword arguments. Note that just like the positional arguments above these keyword arguments can also be passed to shared and static libraries. \nThe list of sources objects and dependencies is always flattened which means you can freely nest and add lists while creating the final list. As a corollary the best way to handle a disabled dependency is by assigning an empty list to it and passing it like any other dependency to the dependencies keyword argument. \nThe returned object also has methods that are documented in the object methods section below. \n"});
