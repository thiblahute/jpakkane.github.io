As an example \nIf you have a directory inside your subprojects directory usually subprojects that is a git submodule meson will automatically initialize it if your build files refer to it. This will be done without needing a wrap file since git contains all the information needed. \nSome dependencies have many ways of being provided. As an example Qt can either be detected via pkg config or qmake. Until now Meson has had a heuristic for selecting which method to choose but sometimes it does the wrong thing. This can now be overridden with the method keyword like this \nThe default behavior of static libraries is to discard all symbols that are not not directly referenced. This may lead to exported symbols being lost. Most compilers support whole archive linking that includes all symbols and code of a given static library. This is exposed with the link_whole keyword. \nNote that Visual Studio compilers only support this functionality on VS and newer. \nUp until now unity builds were either done for every target or none of them. Now unity builds can be specified to be enabled only for subprojects which change seldom and not for the master project which changes a lot. This is enabled by setting the unity option to subprojects. \nMeson now sets the MESONINTROSPECT environment variable in addition to MESON_SOURCE_ROOT and other variables when running scripts. It is guaranteed to point to the correct mesonintrospect script which is important when running meson uninstalled from git or when your PATHs may not be set up correctly. \nSpecifically the following meson functions will set it meson.add_install_script meson.add_postconf_script run_command run_target \n"});
